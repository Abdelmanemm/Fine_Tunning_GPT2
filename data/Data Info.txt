Data From https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/one-million-reddit-jokes
data is a collection of one million jokes form  r/Jokes subreddit data consist of 
multiple features but I only kept title  and  self text which is punchline 
in the process_data.py all the preparation for data was done which include the following
1-importing data
2-droping unwanted columns
3-droping missing values
4-cleaning title column from incorrect values like [removed] which was in about 23% of data
[deleted] was about 19% of data
5-concatnate title with self text to create a joke columns
6-save cleaned data in a csv file so later use to train model
